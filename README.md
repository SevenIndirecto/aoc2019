# Advent of Code 2019

Run any day via:

```bash
cd 2019/<day>/
code.py
```

... if you have python3 available in your path via python3, otherwise just use python to run `code.py`.
Developed on *nix, your milage on Win may vary, though shouuuuuuuuuuuuld be fine.

Had great fun doing these, even though I got stuck on #22 for a long while and took some time off.
But did (re?)learn some modulus arithmetic, prime number abuse, ... was long overdue for looking
into these anyway :). Had to look up hints at least 5 times, but them's the breaks.

Used python 3.7 to brush up on snake wrangling this year and completely reconfigured my vim 8 setup, 
made myself learn some new vim-foo doing it and setup a decent python vim-idea env.
